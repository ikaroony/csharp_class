# csharp_class
stuff i made in my csharp class

you can view these files as text

all of these come from a .cs filetype

## more about
these were made in microsoft visual studio 2022 *(aka vs22)*

all files were the resulting program.cs files

if you want to run these on your computer go nuts

running in terminal is so much work but [here is a guide i found online](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-execute-c-sharp-program-on-cmd-command-line/)

creation date is listed in each file as a comment in the first(ish) line of main

## order of creation:

> celsiusConverter
> 
> centsConverter
> 
> circleArea
> 
> packageWeight
> 
> vendingMachine
